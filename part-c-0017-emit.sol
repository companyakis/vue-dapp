/*
A defined event remains dormant until it's broadcasted or emitted with all required information. 
Emitting an event triggers it, logging details on the blockchain for transaction tracking in client-side applications.

Using emit in Solidity is like lighting a beacon in the dark â€“ it signals an event within a smart contract, making it visible and trackable to external observers, 
similar to how a lit beacon is easily noticeable and provides information to distant onlookers.
