/*
Your Goal: Add Members 
Create a dynamic sized array of addresses called members
Create an external function addMember which has a single parameter: an address for a new member. Add this address to the members array.
Create a public view function isMember that takes an address and returns a bool indicating whether the address is a member or not.
